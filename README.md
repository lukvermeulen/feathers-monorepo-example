# Feathers monorepo example

# About

This is an example repository for a monorepo style full-stack application based on NextJS for the frontend and FeathersJS as the API.
The monorepo is setup with

-   yarn2 workspaces
-   nx (as a command runner and for the generators, could perhaps be replaced)
-   typescript

By default the structure right now looks like the following:

/apps <br/>
----/api (featherjs) <br/>
----/web-client (nextjs) <br/>
/libs <br/>
----/components (react) <br/>

A shared component lib hosts created react components that can be used in other applications.
The web-client imports a typed client from the api.

# Setup

1. run `yarn install` from the root
2. verify the mongodb connection string in /apps/api/config/default.json

# Commands

## api

Start the API with `nx start api` or `nx dev api`

Generally any command specified in the scripts section of `/apps/api/package.json` can be run using `nx <command> api`

## web-client

The api is generated by a nx generator, thus normal nx commands can be used e.g. `nx serve web-client`

# NX

As nx is initialized, its generators can be used. By default `@nrwl/next` and `@nrwl/react` are installed as they
have been used to create the nextjs app and the component library.

You could for example generate a new component in the library with `nx g @nrwl/react:component <ComponentName> --project components`
(this assumes you have the nx cli installed globally).
